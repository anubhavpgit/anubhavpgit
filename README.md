Hi, I am Anubhab Patnaik, a software engineer from India. [Here's my background](https://anubhavp.dev/cv.html) and [here's what I am up to these days](https://anubhavp.dev/current.html).

I work with whatever piques my interest. I used to dabble in ML and now work with web, mobile, and CMD applications. I've been working on a [bit-torrent client](https://github.com/fuzzymfx/b) to download files, written in TypeScript that I plan on porting to Rust. Meanwhile, I am also exploring esoteric programming languages and will work on a brainfuck interpreter soon. I have also been exploring LÃ–VE & Lua to build tactical FPS games. This site (inspired by [blog.matsu.io](https://blog.matsu.io)) is built using [zuzu](https://github.com/fuzzymfx/zuzu), a custom SSG. [Here's more on what I am up to](https://anubhavp.dev/current.html).

I am excited to join StackIt as a software engineering intern. I intend to work with web applications, add features to the product, and build and manage data pipelines to store and retrieve data efficiently. I work part-time at Assymetri, and I polish my coding skills and DSA on [Leetcode](https://leetcode.com/anubhabr50).

A [GitHub Sponsorship](https://github.com/sponsors/fuzzymfx/) page to keep my work sustainable. You can find me on [GitHub](https://github.com/fuzzymfx) and connect with me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/anubhabpatnaik0530/).

Say hi to me at <anubhabr50@gmail.com>.

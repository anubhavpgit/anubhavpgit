Hi, I am Anubhab Patnaik, a SE from India, and a Master's student in computer engineering at NYU from India. [Here's my background](https://anubhavp.dev/journey.html) and [here's what I am up to these days](https://anubhavp.dev/current.html). I used to dabble in ML, web, mobile, and CMD applications. Now, I am mostly involved in building high-performance scalable systems, distibuted applications and low-level compilers. Here are a couple of projects that I am planning to take up sometime soon:

- An image/audio analyzer/decomposer to convert svg to png and vice-versa; decomposing periodic functions using fourier series approximation
- A (short MVP) C/C++ compiler for RISC-V.
- A consistent, memory-safe fast, read/write distributed database built in Go/Rust that implements a distributed caching mechanism like [docstore](https://www.uber.com/en-IN/blog/how-uber-serves-over-40-million-reads-per-second-using-an-integrated-cache/) or [memcached](https://memcached.org/)
- Building a custom AI assisted nutrition manager, [Jude](https://anubhavp.dev/blog/heyjude.html)
- A MVP of a neural sensor hardware to capture finger movements to be used as an input device.

Feel free to DM if interested in working together. Some of my recent projects have been:

- [Game of Life](https://anubhavp.dev/blog/gameoflife.html)- Implementing John Conway's Game of Life and explaining building CPU units using it
- [A RISCV machine code decoder](https://anubhavp.dev/barney)-  a pipelined processor executing machine code instructions with hazard handling and memory safety
- Improvements in [Zuzu](https://github.com/fuzzymfx/zuzu) - The custom static site generator for my site ([anubhavp.dev](https://anubhavp.dev/))
- [Dough](https://github.com/fuzzymfx/dough): a rich, modular, and customisable content generator written in Rust.
- A full-fledged telegram and discord bot to mimic the entire functionality set of [datingAi](datingai.pro) with optimzed API calls limiting exhaustion.

Also Looking for maintainers for [Resoc](https://resoc.in) ( A basic React webpage to host notes for my undergrad college from SIT, BBS).

A [GitHub Sponsorship](https://github.com/sponsors/fuzzymfx/) page to keep my work sustainable. [Here's more about me](https://anubhavp.dev/about.html), and feel free to connect with me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/anubhabpatnaik/).

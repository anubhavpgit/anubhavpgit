Hi, I am Anubhab Patnaik, a software engineer living in New York, from India. [Here's my background](https://anubhavp.dev/journey.html) and [here's what's up](https://anubhavp.dev/current.html). Mostly occupied in scaling startups and building high-performance low-level distibuted applications. 

A couple of projects that I am taking up and some of my recent projects:-

- A tiny GPU kernel enough to be used on Apple Silicon for LLM inference, using llama.cpp
- An image/audio analyzer/decomposer to convert svg to png and vice-versa; decomposing [periodic functions using fourier series approximation](https://anubhavp.dev/blog/fourier)
- Orion: A MVP of a neural sensor hardware to capture finger movements to be used as an input device. (The name is inspired by the motivation to build it- Meta's orion glasses)
- [Fireside](https://anubhavpgit/fireside) - An end-to-end encrypted, decentralized chat app built with GunJS & Svelte, enabling low-latency, secure, and ephemeral messaging. - [Live](https://anubhavp.dev/fireside)
- [Ferry](https://github.com/anubhavp-dev/ferry) - A C compiler for RISC-V, capable of compiling the code for a subset of C language (enough to solve LeetCode!)
- [A RISCV machine code interpreter](https://anubhavp.dev/blog/hacktoberfest)-  a pipelined processor executing machine code instructions with hazard handling and memory safety

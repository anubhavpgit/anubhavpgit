Hi, I am Anubhab Patnaik, a SE from India, and a Master's student in computer engineering at NYU from India. [Here's my background](https://anubhavp.dev/journey.html) and [here's what I am up to these days](https://anubhavp.dev/current.html). I am mostly involved in building high-performance low-level and scalable systems and distibuted applications. Here are a couple of projects that I am planning to take up sometime soon:

- An image/audio analyzer/decomposer to convert svg to png and vice-versa; decomposing periodic functions using fourier series approximation
- A consistent, memory-safe fast, read/write distributed database built in Go/Rust that implements a distributed caching mechanism like [docstore](https://www.uber.com/en-IN/blog/how-uber-serves-over-40-million-reads-per-second-using-an-integrated-cache/) or [memcached](https://memcached.org/)

Feel free to DM if interested in working together. Some of my recent projects have been:

- Orion: A MVP of a neural sensor hardware to capture finger movements to be used as an input device. (The name is inspired by the motivation to build it- Meta's orion glasses)
- [Fireside](https://anubhavpgit/fireside) - An end-to-end encrypted, decentralized chat app built with GunJS & Svelte, enabling low-latency, secure, and ephemeral messaging. - [Live](https://anubhavp.dev/fireside)
- [Ferry](https://github.com/anubhavp-dev/ferry) - A C compiler for RISC-V, capable of compiling the code for a subset of C language (enough to solve LeetCode!)
- [A RISCV machine code interpreter](https://anubhavp.dev/blog/hacktoberfest)-  a pipelined processor executing machine code instructions with hazard handling and memory safety
Also Looking for maintainers for [Resoc](https://resoc.in) ( A basic React webpage to host notes for my undergrad college from SIT, BBS).

A [GitHub Sponsorship](https://github.com/sponsors/muttonbiryani69/) page to keep my work sustainable. [Here's more about me](https://anubhavp.dev/about.html), and feel free to connect with me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/anubhabpatnaik/).

Hi, I am Anubhab Patnaik, a Master's student in computer engineering at NYU from India. [Here's my background](https://anubhavp.dev/journey.html) and [here's what I am up to these days](https://anubhavp.dev/current.html). Currently, I am pursuing a Master's in Computer Engineering at NYU. I used to dabble in ML and work with web, mobile, and CMD applications. Here are a couple of projects that I am planning to take up sometime soon:

- A brainfuck interpreter in brainfuck. A (short MVP) compiler for RISC-V.
- A distributed caching mechanism like [docstore](https://www.uber.com/en-IN/blog/how-uber-serves-over-40-million-reads-per-second-using-an-integrated-cache/) or [memcached](https://memcached.org/)
- Optimising RESOC (Mainly looking for contributors and maintainers here)
- [Audio Types in Fourier Series](https://www.reddit.com/r/math/comments/bn6v5/an_intuitive_explanation_of_fourier_transforms_in/)

Feel free to DM if interested in working together. Some of my recent projects have been:

- Improvements in Zuzu (The custom static site generator for my site)
- Dough: a rich, modular, and customisable content generator written in Rust.
- A full-fledged telegram and discord bot to mimic the entire functionality set of [datingAi](datingai.pro) with optimzed API calls limiting exhaustion.


A [GitHub Sponsorship](https://github.com/sponsors/fuzzymfx/) page to keep my work sustainable. [Here's more about me](https://anubhavp.dev/about.html), and feel free to connect with me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/anubhabpatnaik/).

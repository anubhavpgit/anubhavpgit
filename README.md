Hi, I am Anubhab Patnaik, a software engineer from India. [Here's my background](https://anubhavp.dev/cv.html) and [here's what I am up to these days](https://anubhavp.dev/current.html).

I work with whatever piques my interest. I used to dabble in ML and now work with web, mobile, and CMD applications. I've been working on a [bit-torrent client](https://github.com/fuzzymfx/b) to download files, written in TypeScript that I plan on porting to Rust. Meanwhile, I am also exploring esoteric programming languages and will work on a brainfuck interpreter soon. I have also been exploring LÃ–VE & Lua to build tactical FPS games. Currently, I am working on a pet project, Dough: a rich, modular, and customisable content generator, written in Rust. Meanwhile, I am building StackIt as the founding engineer. [Here's more on what I am up to](https://anubhavp.dev/current.html).

A [GitHub Sponsorship](https://github.com/sponsors/fuzzymfx/) page to keep my work sustainable. Connect with me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/anubhabpatnaik0530/).

Hi, I am Anubhab Patnaik, a software engineer from India. [Here's my background](https://anubhavp.dev/cv.html) and [here's what I am up to these days](https://anubhavp.dev/current.html).

I work with whatever piques my interest. I used to dabble in ML and now work with web, mobile, and CMD applications. I've been working on a custom bit-torrent client to download files using TypeScript, and I plan on porting it to Rust. Meanwhile, I am also exploring esoteric programming languages and will work on a brainfuck interpreter soon. My [website](https://anubhavp.dev/) (inspired from [blog.matsu.io](https://blog.matsu.io)) is built using [zuzu](https://github.com/fuzzymfx/zuzu), a custom SSG.

When not coding up a storm, I work with FOSS communities: I conduct workshops, hackathons, and coding competitions. I built and maintain [cbrtl](https://cbrtl.github.io), a FOSS platform for students to showcase their work and get recognition for their work.

A [GitHub Sponsorship](https://github.com/sponsors/fuzzymfx/) page to keep my work sustainable. You can find me on [GitHub](https://github.com/fuzzymfx) and connect with me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/anubhabpatnaik0530/).

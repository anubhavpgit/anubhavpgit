Hi, I am Anubhab Patnaik, a software engineer from India. [Here's my background](https://anubhavp.dev/cv.html) and [here's what I am up to these days](https://anubhavp.dev/current.html).

I work with whatever piques my interest. I used to dabble in ML and now work with web, mobile, and CMD applications. Currently, I am preparing for job interviews, and I polish my coding skills on [Leetcode](https://leetcode.com/anubhabr50). I've also been working on a [bit-torrent client](https://github.com/fuzzymfx/b) to download files, written in TypeScript that I plan on porting to Rust. Meanwhile, I am also exploring esoteric programming languages and will work on a brainfuck interpreter soon. I have also been exploring LÃ–VE & Lua to build tactiacl FPS games. This site (inspired by [blog.matsu.io](https://blog.matsu.io)) is built using [zuzu](https://github.com/fuzzymfx/zuzu), a custom SSG. [Here's more on what I am up to](https://anubhavp.dev/current.html).

When not coding up a storm, I work with FOSS communities: I conduct workshops, hackathons, and coding competitions. I built and maintain [cbrtl](https://cbrtl.github.io), a FOSS platform for students to showcase their work and get recognition for their work.

A [GitHub Sponsorship](https://github.com/sponsors/fuzzymfx/) page to keep my work sustainable. You can find me on [GitHub](https://github.com/fuzzymfx) and connect with me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/anubhabpatnaik0530/).

Say hi to me at <anubhabr50@gmail.com>.
